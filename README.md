<h1>Project 2: Journal In Space</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>

The second GA Software Engineering immersive course project was in week 7 of the course, with the brief of building a React app that consumes a public API.  We chose an Open API provided by NASA called Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD), which updates daily with NASA photography, an explanation, along with other data, that we would display in our React app and then deploy to the web.
